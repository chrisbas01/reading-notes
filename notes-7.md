JavaScript


"Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script."

"Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops."
So, keep the codes in order inwhich you wanted them excuted.

"A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Example
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}"
