I am doing well at picking up some of the commands, I have a ways to go before I will be fully confident in my abilities. I feel like it’s easy to understand each lesson so far, but there are so many tricks to it, I know that I have barely scratched the surface. I know I lack at following the directions fully, but I am working hard to keep up and get full marks for each assignment. I do enjoy it! It’s still very early in this journey. I am excited to see my progress in the coming week!
