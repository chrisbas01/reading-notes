Review what we all ready know about css.
what is css? why do we use it? how?

cascading style sheets
you can write in 3 ways

external   separate css file connected to html

internal    css is built into the  html file

inline     css a built inoto the gtml element itself

class and id selectors  ways to grab(select)the html elements

selectors(property value)

positioning static relative, absolute and fixed.

html is the framwork structer
css is the style makes every thing look better

browsers are user agents 

css is readable regardless of when the webpage was writen, because when they write it they make sure it doesnt affect past css

certain browser may not be compatible with some of the css.

External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Cascading Order

What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

Inline style (inside an HTML element)

External and internal style sheets (in the head section)

Browser default

display (inline-block) li nav{ selects all list items in the nav}
list-style:none
