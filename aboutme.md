## What is "*growth mindset*" to me? 
### Having a growth mindset is very importaint for me. I believe it is having the ability to always adapt to challenges and find ways to overcome them.  

1. Always be willing to adapt.
2. There is always more then one way to solve a problem, so don't be set in one way of thinking.
3. Be willing to admit you may be wrong or that you may not understand something.
4. You must always be willing to ask for help (two heads are better than one.
