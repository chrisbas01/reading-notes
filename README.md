### What is "growth mindset" to me? 
1. I believe a growth mindset begins with the ability to adapt.
2. To have a growth mindset its best not to be set in one way of thinking about things.
3. You shiould be willing to admit you may be wrong or not understand something.
4. You must always be willing to ask for help.
